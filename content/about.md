Fabio Alessandro (Fale) Locati is a Senior Consultant at Red Hat, public speaker, entrepreneur, author and Open Source contributor.
His main areas of expertise are Linux, security, cloud technologies, databases, networking, and data centres.

With more than 10 years of working experience in the field, he has experienced different IT roles, technologies, and languages.
Fabio has worked for many different companies, starting from a one-man company to huge companies such as Tech Data and Samsung.
This has allowed him to consider various technologies from different points of view, helping him develop critical thinking and understand very quickly whether a particular technology is the right one for a specific project or not.

Since he is always looking for better technologies, he also tries new technologies to see their advantages over the old ones and their maturity status.
One of the most important things Fabio evaluates about a technology is its internal security and the possibility of additional security through configuration or interaction with the other technologies.

Often he gives talks about his work, the projects he helps in his spare time and his vision of IT and security worlds.
He is the author of the books [Learning Anisble 2](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/learning-ansible-2-second-edition) and [OpenStack Cloud Security](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/openstack-cloud-security/).
In the spare time he helps out the Fedora Project, Ansible, Wikimedia, and Open Street Map.
