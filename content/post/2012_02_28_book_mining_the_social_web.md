Mining the Social Web is a good start for anyone is going to create scripts to analyze patterns in Social Networks.
I've to say that this book consider that the reader already masters **Python**.
I think that should be written directly on the title (ie: "Mining the Social Web with Python").

I liked the really fast approach to the Social Networks, even if a lot of times I wanted more; for this reason I consider it only a start, not a complete book.

The part I really enjoyed was the one about the HTML5 microformats.
This is the only book that cover the topic from the data mining point of view, as far as I've seen.

I had the pleasure to read this book in the e-book version, and I've to admit that O'Reilly did a really good job in linking the different parts of the book through hyperlinks.

The biggest part of the book is focused more on **what** text is important rather that **why** it is important.
In the book is touched the **why** speaking about the Semantic Web processing, but this is beyond the goal of this book, I suppose.

I would recommend this book only to those people who are willing to have a starting point on the web mining or who is trying to understand if the topic is interesting for him/her.

**Disclaimer:** I received a free electronic copy of this book as part of the O'Reilly Blogger Program
