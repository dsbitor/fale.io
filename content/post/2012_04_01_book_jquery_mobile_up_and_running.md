jQuery Mobile is a library that allows you to develop mobile apps using jQuery.
Is even possible to use a jQuery Mobile program as a native app, thanks to programs like PhoneGap.

This book assumes that you already know jQuery and I think that this is good since the author can focus only on the main topic in this way.
I think you should know or study jQuery before even starting this book.
I do know that's possible to understand jQuery code even if you don't know anything of JavaScript if you have rock solid programming knowledge, but I discourage it.

I really liked this book since it says what to do and what not to do for each of the ten sections.
Also it has hundreds of images that will help you through the learning process.

I would suggest this book to everyone who is interested into developing a cross-platform app or a mobile website.
