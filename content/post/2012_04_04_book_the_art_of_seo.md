Since the four authors are very popular in the SEO field, I was expecting the best book on SEO ever. All my expectation have been met.

I think that the book authors have done a great job describing these difficult concept in an easy and ordered way.
The book, also, is very complete.
The touched topics include: user-focussed data, key analytical tools, effective website creation, result tracking, search engine theory and behaviour, the impact of social media, SEO best practices and much more.
Sometimes the authors deviate from the topics usually covered in SEO books, in fact you can find topics like In-house vs outsourced SEO.

All the chapters are full of links and the book is supported by a <a href="http://artofseobook.com">website</a>.

I'm really happy to have invested time in reading this book.
This is definitely the best SEO book I've ever read and probably one of the best IT book I've ever read.
I hope to see the Third version before 2015 (First edition: 2009, Second edition: 2012), since the SEO world is quickly changing so three years would mean that for about half of the Second Edition life it will contain a lot of reference to old things.

I would definitely advise all the people that would like to promote a website or are interested into SEO for hobby or work to read this book.
I also believe that people who decided to outsource their site SEO would have benefits reading this book.
