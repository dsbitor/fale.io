This book starts with a little introduction and with the instructions to setup the environment.
After this, the book starts at full speed with "the Recipes".
The structure based on Recipes is what I liked the of this book.
Every Recipe has the structure:

* Problem
* Solution
* Discussion

I think that this is a very powerful structure because in this way we can learn from the obstacles that each one of us can encounter in his way while coding.
Also, this structure, gives to the reader the choice of what read when.
In fact, is possible to read this book from the first page to the last or to pick the single arguments that are useful to him in that precise moment.
Another thing that I really liked about this book is the fact that Jamie Munro uses in the same time PhoneGap and jQuery Mobile so you can learn two libraries in the same time and you can learn immediately to write an application that is nice to see and use.
I really liked this book and I would suggest this book to everyone is interested in using the PhoneGap framework to develop Mobile applications.
