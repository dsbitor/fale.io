This book is pretty short (258 pages long) but is very dense. It is divided into 6 chapters + one appendix.

For each atomic argument, the author does propose 1 to 3 True-or-False questions, their answer and the explanation. I did like the question-answer approach, since you understand immediately which is your level, therefore you can understand which parts you have to cover more and which less. What I did not liked at all about this structure is the layout. Every question is answered right below the question itself. I think this is a very bad approach, since is really hard to answer to a True-or-False question without looking at the answer that you know is there. I think they should have putted all the chapter questions and after all the chapter answers.

At the end of the day, I would suggest this book to anyone interested in the CompTIA Security+ exam. I think the book will not fit the reader needs if the reader is not interested in the exam itself. I would also suggest to anyone willing to do the exam to relay on a different book to study and use this one only for reviewing the concepts before the exam.

You can find the book at [O'Reilly website](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0790145349989.do).
