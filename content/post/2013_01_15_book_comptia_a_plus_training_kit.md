Reading this book has helped me a lot understanding better how the A+ exam works. This book is tailored for the CompTIA A+ certification (and this led me to this book instead of another one, since I'm looking forward to take this certification).

I really liked the fact that every chapter does cover conclusively an argument. In this way, you can choose which arguments read based on your interests and your needs.

As all the other Microsoft book I reviewed, I really think they should increase the number of exercises. Four to twenty questions for each chapters is definitely too few to prepare an exam.

The book does come with a CD, but I have not been able to use it in any useful ways, since I'm a Linux user and therefore I can't play CD designed for Windows and I already had the eBook.

Even if the book is written and structured for the CompTIA A+ exam, I think that anyone that wants to have an idea about how the IT world works.

I would suggest this book to a friend since the value of the book is really high and the price is not too high. Surely if he is a non-Windows user I would tell him not to count on the CD contents.

You can find the book at [O'Reilly website](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0790145335333.do).
