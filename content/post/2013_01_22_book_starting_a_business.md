As the title suggests, the book is pretty short (the PDF version count 161 pages) and so it's really a few reading hours.

The book is divided in 5 chapters:

* **Planning**: this chapter covers the Business Plan and all the accessories planning. From my experience (and the author too) a good plan is mandatory if you don't want see your great idea failing.
* **Getting Financed**: this short chapter (only 12 pages long) gives you some information and advice about the financial part of the company.
* **Getting started**: here you can find a lot of good advice and general information about marketing, patenting, copyright and other important things you should know.
* **Staying alive**: here you'll find information and advice on taxes, press releases and other things that will keep your company going.
* **When tomorrow becomes today**: in this short chapter (only 5 pages long) are highlighted some differences between ordinary business and web business.

The book is written with no specific sector in mind. This book can be read and found useful to a person that wants to open a pub or a person that wants to open an IT start-up. If this is good because anyone will find something for him, is bad because no one will find all information she needs.

I think the book is full of good suggestions, but a huge part is simple common sense. If you have no idea about where to start or if you do not know any entrepreneur, this is the right book for you.

You can find the book at [O'Reilly website](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0790145349989.do).
