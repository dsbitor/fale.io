<img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/9780735673670/cat.gif" width="180" height="220" /> I come to this book less than a month after reviewing the [70-410 Exam Ref](http://fabiolocati.com/2012/12/exam-ref-70-410-installing-and-configuring-windows-server-2012-by-craig-zacker).  As the title may suggest, this book is tailored to the preparation of the Microsoft 70-413 exam. Speaking of the exam, I have to advice that the book does cover any exam objective, but does not cover every exam question.

The book is split into an introduction, 5 chapters and the index. The first chapter helps to understand how to plan and deploy a server infrastructure. The other four are focused on the designing and implementation of the various components: network infrastructure services (chapter 2), network access services (chapter 3), Active Directory logical infrastructure (chapter 4) and Active Directory physical infrastructure (chapter 5).
A thing I liked about this book is the presence of questions (with detailed answers). What is improvable for these question is the number. I think they should put way more questions. So, the questions, are a good idea not well implemented. The only thing I hoped to see on this book but is missing is the emphasis on the security.

I would definitely suggest this book to everyone is willing to take the Microsoft 70-410 exam. If you are really interested in Microsoft's implementation of networking and Active Directories, I would also suggest this book. If, in the other hand, you are interested in the standard ways to do these things, another book can be more suitable for you.

You can find this book at the [O'Reilly on-line store](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0790145370242.do).
