This book initially shocked me. When I downloaded it, it was a 140 Mb so I thought it was full of drawings and comics. As soon as I opened the file I saw it was nothing I thought it would have been.

The book is mainly written (it can seem tautological  but I think that's right to point it out) with a lot of photos. I think the reason of the "hugeness" of the file is given by the photos. Speaking of them, I think that some of them are really useful to understand the concepts that are being explained in the text, while others can be removed without removing any value from the book.
Speaking of the authors, it's really interesting to spend a few words on their biography. James H. Carrott is really interested in history, while Brian David Johnson is a futurist at Intel. Two people with such a different background have been able to create a very high-level book.

I would strongly suggest this great book to anyone that is interested in understanding deeply the Steampunk culture. This reading can be perfect for both the person who wants to discover the Steampunk world for the first time, and to who has already a knowledge of this world and wants to improve it and have some new points to ponder.

You can find this book at the [O'Reilly website](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026631.do).
