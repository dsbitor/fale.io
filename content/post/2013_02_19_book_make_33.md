It's Make! I think Make is one of the greatest, if not the greatest magazine available worldwide.
I think that this is a really cool number of Make.
As it usually happens to me, the part I like the most i the "Projects part", in which I always find awesome ideas.

The article I liked the most is "Growing the Ghost" by Gabriel Nagmay.
This article speaks about the growing of the Bhut Jolokia, one of the world most powerful chili flavour.
I really liked it since I really like peppers and the author gave me a lot of ideas and tips on how to feed the peppers properly.

Another article I really enjoyed, even if I'm not interested in building it is "The Counting Box" by Nathan Pryor.
I really liked how he created a such nice object with such a great User eXperience.

I also really enjoyed the "Made on Earth" column and more specifically the "Sing with the Wind" part.
I think that the artwork described in this part (the Aelus Acustic Wind Pavilion) is incredible.
The artist has been able to add the audio part to the artwork.
I think this is good but not amazing, by itself.
The thing that makes this artwork amazing is the fact that uses NO energy at all to produce the sounds.

I would definitely suggest this Make issue to my friends :).

You can find this Make issue at the [O'Reilly on-line store](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025221.do)
