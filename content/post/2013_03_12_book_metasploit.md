Metasploit is an entire suite of tools and methodologies designed for testing the security of computers and networks.

The book is written for both experienced penetration tester and people new to the security field. For the first group, one of the most interesting thing is the explanation of the rules and ideas that formed the Penetration Test Execution Standard, while for users new to the field, is really interesting what can be done and how.<!--more-->One thing that make this book so unique is the fact that is written by four people with really different backgrounds and this help the read to understand different ways to see the security.

An aspect that really shaped this book as we can see it now, is the development speed of Metasploit that did not allow a "standard" manual. In this way, I think, the authors have created a book of way higher value.

Overall, I think the book is really good for both the people that are new to the security field and to the people with years in the field. I would suggest the book to both category.

You can find the book at [O'Reilly website](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781593272883.do).
