Very few think to the Bluetooth. Even fewer people think to all the other technologies that use wireless technology to work, such as cordless phone, guard radios, headsets, wireless camera etc. This book embrace the last point of view.

The first chapter provides basic information and motivation for Wireless Profiling.

The chapter 2 provides the reader with all the information she needs to be able to understand the wireless technology and it's usage.

Chapters 3 to 7 teach to the reader how the Wireless Penetration works.

Chapter 8 brings up a case study that is really interesting.

Chapter 9 gives information about the new technologies and how to use them.

A thing that I appreciated a lot, is that the authors really make it clear to always remember laws and RoE (Rules of Engagement) and to always check that what you are doing is complaint with both.

I would suggest this book to anyone interested in the Penetration Testing and in the Wireless technology. In this book you'll find a lot of really useful tools and rules that are applicable in any kind of penetration testing.
