Well, this book will make you change your opinion. This book will change your idea of security and therefor you'll start to see anything as "probably having some security glitch".

Mike Shema speaks about a lot of different kind of attacks in his book in a real deep way, at the point that sometimes I wondered if he was planning to instruct people how to hack websites or only how to secure own websites. The book has often some code samples that allow a faster understanding of what the author is saying. Even if a coding knowledge is not required, the ability to understand HTML, JS, SQL, PHP, Python and C++ speeds up the reading.

Somewhere in the introduction, the author declares that the book is good for different type of people, including executive level management. Even if I agree with the author that this book has a wide audience, I don't agree about the executive level management being in the audience of the book because I think it would be too specific and technical for a person with that kind of focus. I would mainly suggest this book to any developer that has not yet read it and to any project manager that has to deal with products that may expose security glitch.

You can find the book at [O'Reilly website](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781597499514.do).
