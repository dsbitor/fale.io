Being a Maker Media product, I thought it was somehow similar to the Make magazine. I was very wrong: in the whole book there are less then 10 images/photos.

This is a good thing, if you like to read because allows the author to put way more contents than if he had to put more images and it keeps the file size small (~23Mb).

What I really appreciated about this book over all the other book on how to became a Maker is the author's attempt to keep the needed budget low. A lot of times I've seen books where the author write things to do as if the reader has tens of thousands euros to spend on this.

Another thing that I really liked about this book is the fact that David Lang, the book author, has a really strong Maker philosophy. This helps a lot the reader to understand why things are in some way and not in others. Also, my Maker philosophy is really similar to the author's one, so we are always on the same page.

I liked this book, and I would suggest it to anyone would like to learn a lot about of the Maker culture. I would not suggest this book to the people that hate reading since is a pretty solid-text book, while you can find other books with less text in them (and also less contents, but the trade-off could be good enough for you).

You can find the book at [O'Reilly website](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028284.do).
