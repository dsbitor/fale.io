Hi guys, my name is Fabio Alessandro Locati and I’m a Fedora packager involved in multiple packages.
Also I’m in the process of becoming an Ambassador.
I’m an Italian freelance system administrator and system architect.

This is my first blog post on Planet Fedora and I think I’ll post here mainly about the packages I’m involved with, I will also – sometimes – blog about events, Fedora and Linux in general :).
