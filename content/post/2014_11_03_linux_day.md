---

In Italy every year, during the last weekend of October, there is the Linux Day, an “open day” for the LUGs where they create events to publicize GNU/Linux and the Free Software. As usual (for the last 5 years now), the ViGLug organized it’s event and this time has been in Melzo, a city less than half hour drive east from Milan. We had a very nice event with more than 50 new people coming to learn about Linux and its wonderful world.

This year we also had some Fedora swags and a Fedora Talk done by Francesco Frassinelli (frafra). Thanks to Andrea Boero (Tsumi), a fellow linux user of the ViGLug for this picture (CC-BY 4.0 - Andrea Boero) of the booth :).

It has been wonderful to see how many people are interested in GNU/Linux and Fedora in particular. In a few days (maybe even week, given the average time between posts I have lately), I’ll post more about my thoughts on new users and DEs.

Thanks to the awesome Linux Day we had, I really look forward to meet all ViGLug people (and new people too, obviously) during tomorrow ViGLug meeting.
