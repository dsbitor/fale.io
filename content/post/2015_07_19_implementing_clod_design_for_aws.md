Today the IT world is moving very quickly from the classic infrastructure with servers, switches, hard disks and so on to virtual infrastructures, where all those things are simple pieces of software faking to be real objects.
This has huge benefits, and this is why so many companies are doing this.
Along with the advantages, this new way of doing IT has it's criticality that the administrators have to know to prevent possible problems to happen.
A lot of books that speaks about cloud technology forget to start from the basics of cloud and very often skip these concepts.
This book does not, and I greatly appreciated it.
