In the last few weeks I've worked toward bringing qBittorrent 3.3.1 to Fedora and EL7.
Today I've requested the stable branch for Fedora 23 and in the next few days I'll do the same for Fedora and EL7.

Why am I writing about it instead of just leaving the updates come to you with the classical "dnf update"? Simply because this is a huge and very interesting update.
The biggest change in this update has been the switch from Qt4 to Qt5.
It should be pretty stable since qBittorent has been able to compile against Qt5 for more than one year and Fedora already has a lot of Qt5 packages.
So why waiting for such a long period before switching Qt version in Fedora packages?
We decided to respect the upstream decision to wait, so we switched to the Qt5 dependency when they did it.

With this update will also come an updated version of rb_libtorrent, the torrent library used by qBittorrent.

I hope qBittorrent will work properly for you as it did for those who tested it on [Bodhi](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2015-92fcafd752) and, if this is not the case, please report the bugs you encounter on the [bug tracker](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/).
