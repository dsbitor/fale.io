Few days ago, on November 23, we have had a Fedora 23 release party in Milan, as [we announced in the wiki](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Release_Party_F23_Milan).

This time we did something different from the previous one (the Fedora 21 release party) because we tried to do it in Milan, while the previous time we did it in Cernusco sul Naviglio that is a city very close to Milan.

The number of people that participated at the event was below expectation, but probably this is not only caused by the more central location, but also the limited planning time we had due to the location that has been provided to us by StartMiUp, a coworking space.

Even with those small things that will be more in our focus next time, we had a great time and a great cake :).
