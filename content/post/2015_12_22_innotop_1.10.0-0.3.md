Innotop is a tool that allows you to control the status of a MySQL/MariaDB database. It is widely used since it shows the data with an interface very similiar to the *top* one.

Lately it's development has slowed down, but small changes do come regularly.

The biggest change this time (compared to the 1.10.0-0.2 version) is the addition of a patch that allows innotop to work properly with MariaDB 10.1 and 10.2 that has recently hit the Fedora 24 repositories.

I've pushed the update to all testing branches ([EL5](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2015-e996f86bc2), [EL6](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2015-154331c792), [EL7](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2015-c23f5a2e04), [F22](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2015-b0a57c6496), [F23](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2015-e888c70b6b)) and to the F24 main repository. I hope some people will test it!
