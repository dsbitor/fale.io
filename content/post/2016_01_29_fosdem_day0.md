For years I wanted to attend some major FLOSS conferences, but I've never had the occasion since I've always had other things to do in the conferences dates.
This year, due to multiple causes and good planning, I've been able to go to FOSDEM :).

One thing that I like to do at all kind of events, but even more in big events, is to volunteer.
Volunteering, in my opinion, gives you big advantages, since you often can find very interesting people.

During my volunteer duty I had the occasion to shot this photo at the K building hall, where the day after many booth would be placed (the left-most table is the Fedora booth :)).
