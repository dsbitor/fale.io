This morning I've assisted to one of the most fun and interesting talk I've have ever seen.
I'm talking about the talk of **Richard M Stallman** on licensing and patents.
I've really liked how the talk has been conducted by the speakers and I think the contents were great (you can probably find it available online and if I'll find a link, I'll post it).

After Stallman's talk, I went to listen **Langdon White** talk **Re-thinking Linux Distributions**.
I think this was a great talk, and even if I do not agree completely with Langdon, he made very good point and he explained a lot of things that are going on in the Fedora's modularization effort.

I also had the occasion to see the **Remy DeCausemaker** talk **The Fedora Project By the Numbers**.
This is probably one of the few occasion where FLOSS projects are able to give numbers (although some disclaimers about them are needed).
I think this is a great starting point for the FLOSS community and more specifically for Fedora.
In the business sector, numbers and statistics have become the absolute base of any discussion and decision, while the FLOSS projects did not have any number about the projects, mainly because for FLOSS project is really hard to collect data.
Those data are probably still not perfect, but it's a huge step in the right direction from my point of view.

Another nice thing I've done today is the FOSDEM Key Signing Party.
I think it was very nice even if it was pretty long and toward the end of it a little bit challenging from a concentration point of view.
