Few days past from FOSDEM and I'm at yet another conference :).

Today I flew to Wien and then took a train to Brno.

After the hotel check-in I went to the conference location and I had a nice time with the Red Hat people while we were preparing the location for the event.
The majority of the work was already done when I arrived, but few things were still missing (mainly indications to make users life easier like arrows pointing to the rooms, schedules, etc) so I got the opportunity to help :).

I'm really looking forward for tomorrow because there are a lot of very interesting talks.
