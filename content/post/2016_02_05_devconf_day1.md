This morning things started in the right way.
My day started with Tim Burke's talk and it was _very_ interesting.

After that talk, I attended the Adam Miller talk about immutable infrastructures and Daniel Walsh talk about Docker vs Systemd and I enjoyed them all :).

Later on I had a very nice hallway talk with Remy DeCausemaker about local communities and translations, followed by an actual meeting about globalization in Fedora.

It has been a very interesting day and I'm really looking forward for other two days of this awesome conference.
