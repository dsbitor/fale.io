In the last few days I've been at the CodeMotion Amsterdam 2016.
This was my first CodeMotion and I have to say that I'm very impressed.
The organization was awesome, the talks very high level and the location, well, more than awesome - as you can see in the picture.

In those couple of days I had the opportunity to speak with many people, the majority of which are developers, and I learned a lot on the developer point of view of DevOps and containers.
It seems like developers are even more interested and excited than operations people from this paradigm shift, from what I saw.
