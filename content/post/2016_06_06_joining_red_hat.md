title: "Joining Red Hat"
---
After more than 12 years as a freelance consultant, today I start a new adventure within Red Hat.
I've always admired Red Hat capability to run a multi billion dollars business selling services (subscriptions, training, and consultancy) on top of free software, so when I got the opportunity to join Red Hat I gladly accepted.

Joining Red Hat I'll not change completely what I do, since I'll go forward being a Consultant and I'll work on similar products to the ones I work with today.
