In Italy every year, during the last weekend of October, there is the Linux Day, an “open day” for the LUGs where they create events to publicize GNU/Linux and the Free Software.
As usual (for the last 7 years now), the ViGLug organized this event and this time has been in Bernareggio (MB), a city less than half hour drive north-east from Milan.
This year, for the first time in the ViGLug life, we have partnered up with other two organizations BrigX (the Bernareggio LUG) and the Coderdojo Brianza.
This allowed us to have more diverse contents and to reach more people.

In this edition, I was not able to help out with the organization, and I'd like to thank all people of those three organizations that organized the event since the event was very well organized :).
It has been wonderful to see how many people are interested in GNU/Linux and Fedora in particular.
